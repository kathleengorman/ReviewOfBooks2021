Building a 'tribute page' for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification.

Must fulfill the following user stories:

<b>User Story #1:</b> My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

<b>User Story #2:</b> I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

<b>User Story #3:</b> I should see either a figure or a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

<b>User Story #4:</b> Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

<b>User Story #5:</b> Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

<b>User Story #6:</b> I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

<b>User Story #7:</b> I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

<b>User Story #8:</b> The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

<b>User Story #9:</b> The img element should be centered within its parent element.
