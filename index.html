        <div id="page-info"> Below are some reviews of books I have read over the past year.</div>

      <div class="book-left">
        <h2> <br>A Scanner Darkly </h2>
        <h3> Philip K. Dick </h3>
        <img id= "img-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J0NtPa5bL.jpg" alt="Book cover for Philip K Dick's A Scanner Darkly">
        <p id="right">I’ve been avoiding sci-fi - l am passionate about its themes, but became discouraged by the Ballardian format of neurotic man hates his wife something something evil machines something something submit to dystopia. As I type, I am realising in real-time that this book, that I loved, follows this exact narrative… I am still contemplating Dick’s parable of high-tech police surveillance in a drug epidemic, and was equally captivated by Richard Linklater’s film adaptation. </p>

        <h2 id="left"> <br>Detransition, Baby</h2>
        <h3 id=left> Torrey Peters </h3>
        <p id="left">With much regret, I chose to listen to the audiobook, which was narrated by an insufferably nasally, sarcastic voice. Paired with sanctimonious Tumblr-speak dialogue, this was, at times, grating - but also sometimes appropriate as Peters explores the nuances of victimhood and privilege across gender, race, and motherhood. In exposing the duality of their vulnerabilities and selfishness, she paints a gorgeous character study of an unconventional family unit <br>who are really hard to root for.</p>

          <h2> <br>My Year of Rest and Relaxation </h2>
          <h3> Ottessa Moshfegh </h3>
          <img id= "img-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q-2M7vWIL.jpg" alt="Book cover for Otessa Moshfegh's book My Year of Rest and Relaxation">
          <p id="right">I couldn’t care less if enjoying this novel makes me a basic bitch! I felt a visceral empathy for the protagonist, who is loathsome, disillusioned by equally loathsome artistic types, and suicidal despite having no material reason to be. Her grief and loneliness was a painful reminder of my year in lockdown, during which I watched the entirety of the Sopranos, twice, because I was too depressed to remember anything that happened the time around. I’m so biased that I can even excuse the RIDICULOUS ending.</p>

          <h2 id="left"> <br>Serotonin</h2>
          <h3 id=left> Michel Houellebecq </h3>
          <p id="left">I’ll admit I was lured in by curiosity of his cult status - a “transgressive” and “provocative” writer to some, and a racist misogynist to others. I have no aversion to problematic characters, and, in Houellebecq’s defence, I believe his portrayal of the ‘male gaze’ through his sex-obsessed male protagonists to be more accurate than most would like to admit. With that being said, I literally can’t remember the difference between this and his previous novel, ‘Submission’.  <br> Boring!</p>

            <h2> <br>Another Roadside Attraction</h2>
            <h3> Tom Robbins</h3>
            <img id= "img-left" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327866271l/9570.jpg" alt="Book cover for Tom Robbins' book Another Roadside Attraction">
            <p id="right">This book was the most challenging to read but yields the greatest reward. Robbins’ illustration of his characters and their ventures in Washington State verges into the realm of fantasy, teasing us with the actual meat of the story for what feels like forever. It’s all worth it though - I was thoroughly enchanted by this absurd tale involving themes that satisfy my perverse - perhaps Freudian - fascination with hot dogs and the Catholic Church.<br><br></p>

  <h3 id=left> Sayaka Murata </h3>
  <p id="left"><br>I adored ‘Convenience Store Woman’, and was thrilled to be gifted her most recently translated work. <br>Words cannot describe how truly fucked up this book is. <br><br><br><br><br></p>
